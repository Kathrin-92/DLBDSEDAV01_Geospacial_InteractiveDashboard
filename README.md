## General-Info
This Dashboard allows to interactively explore life expectancy across the globe. The program was developed as part of a university project (B.Sc. Data Science). 

Part of the dashboard and project is the analysis of a geospacial dataset and the creation of five visualizations, including a choropleth map, two line charts, a data card, as well as a bar chart. All visuals are interactive and reactive to one another.
