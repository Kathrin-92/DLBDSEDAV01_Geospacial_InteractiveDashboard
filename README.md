## General Info
This Dashboard allows to interactively explore life expectancy across the globe. 
From conception and design to every line of code, the entire Dashboard was worked on by myself. 
During this project, I was able to deepen my knowledge about Dash and plotly.express. 
Especially, I was able to familiarize myself with geospacial datasets and work on my data visualization skills, which I greatly enjoied! 

Part of the dashboard and project is the analysis of a geospacial dataset and the creation of five visualizations, including a choropleth map, two line charts, a data card, as well as a bar chart. All visuals are interactive and reactive to one another. 

The code was developed as part of a university project (B.Sc. Data Science, Explorative Data Analysis and Visualization).
